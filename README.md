# Simple Linear Regression Case Study
This repository contains a simple linear regression case study that predicts students' **final exam scores** based on the **number of hours studied**.

## Contents
- `regression.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full code and explanation.
- `regression.py` – Python script version.
- `result.png` – Visualization of the regression line.

## Goal
To demonstrate a basic **machine learning workflow** using Python and scikit-learn:
1. Prepare data
2. Train a simple linear regression model
3. Make predictions
4. Visualize results
